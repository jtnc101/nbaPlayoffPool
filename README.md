# nbaPlayoffPool

## HOW THE POOL WORKS

	1. Each team name corresponds to pool participants. 
	2. Each participant will take turn choosing an active nba player. This player is cross checked with the players actively in nba. 
	And it is crosschecked to make sure no other participants chose said player. Player names are matched exactly regarding capital letters. This is
	due to the database select matching the names exactly. 
	3. Year to year, there are varying number of participants so there is an option to add and minus teams. 
	4. For ease of selecting players, the nba players list can be filtered by teams  and when playoffs start, filtered by injuries.
	5. Players can be sorted by points and name.
